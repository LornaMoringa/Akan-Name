        <h2>What is Akan naming system?</h2>
    <p>Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries such as Togo, Ivory Coast and GhanTa. A child's name is determined by factors surrounding his or her birth. For example, the day of their birth or the manner in which they were born may determine which name they get irrespective of their gender.</p>
    <p>Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date. This web application takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.</p>
